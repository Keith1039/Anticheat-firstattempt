The original idea is to have the save file saved in 2 places. Locally on the device and then on the cloud. When using the load function, the program will
check for any changes made to the original save file. Since I don't have/don't know how to use a server, This remains as just a cool idea I had. I might
come back to this when I have more knowledge.
